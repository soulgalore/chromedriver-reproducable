# Base setup for creating reproducable test case for bugs in Chromedriver
It happens that we find problems with Chromedriver in Browsertime/sitespeed.io and we need to file a bug report with reproducable test case.

You can use the package.json and index.js as base. Make sure to update package.json to use the latest Chromedriver and then change index.js to test what you want.
